In this session, you will learn the fundamental architectural constraints that define REST and how you can implement those constraints using ASP.NET Web API. You’ll learn what things you need to do to implement the capabilities that all Web API services should do, such as focus on resources, representations, URIs, content-negotiation, HTTP verbs and headers and so on, as well as the concept of hypermedia and how it pertains to RESTful services.",

Some devices use WiFi, but that can be overkill for a device with only simple communication needs, not to mention providing another potential attack surface in your network. Other options include Bluetooth, and good old serial communications, or a combination of these options.   In this session, you'll learn about many of the available options for communicating between microcontroller-driven devices and PCs or internet-based services, including Microsoft Azure-based services. You'll see examples of reading sensor information and using a phone or PC to control devices remotely.
